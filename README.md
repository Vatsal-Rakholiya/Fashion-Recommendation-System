# Fashion-Recommendation-System
 
# Fashion Discoverer

Introducing a Fashion Discoverer, a novel recommendation system harnessing image similarity techniques to offer personalized apparel suggestions based on visual preferences. Our system implements advanced preprocessing techniques, resizing input images and extracting high-dimensional embeddings using a pre-trained Xception network.

## Key Features

- Smart Image Matching: Our system employs sophisticated image embeddings and cosine similarity to swiftly match fashion items based on visual likeness.
- Dimensionality Streamlining: Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we condense embeddings to 128 dimensions, accelerating similarity computations without compromising accuracy.
- Unique Recommendation Algorithm: Unveiling an innovative recommendation algorithm, we present users with the most compatible fashion items, solely based on visual similarity.
- User-Centric Interface: Deployed via the intuitive Streamlit app, our interface empowers users to effortlessly explore and receive tailored fashion recommendations.
